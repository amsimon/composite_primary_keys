h1. Composite Primary Keys

h1. -> Ruby on Rails

h1. -> ActiveRecords

h2. What

Ruby on Rails does not support composite primary keys. This free software is an extension 
to the database layer of Rails - "ActiveRecords":http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/ActiveRecord - to support composite primary keys as transparently as possible.

Any Ruby script using ActiveRecords can use Composite Primary Keys with this library.
